		<p class="p2">However, I still remember my last birthday in kindergarten. The teacher drew a beautiful poster on the movable blackboard for me, and my mom brought a birthday cake to the kindergarten. All the other children sang the birthday song around me. I also remember one children’s day, when all the classrooms were turned to game room and each room was a different game. Children went to the room they want and played the game then won gifts.</p> 

		<p class="p3">When writing down my memories, I realized that actually I still remember a lot about that time.</p>
