		<p class="p1">College is still a new and novel concept for me right now. I come to a new country and speaks my second language. I meet new friends from different countries. I learn to use new computer software to finish assignment. Everything in college is new.</p>

		<p class="p2">My parents told me that college is like a transition station for young adults to exchange the train running ahead to career life where is full of mature adults. However, I think college is more similar to kindergarten. We young adults become children in kindergarten again.</p> 

		<p class="p3">College allows me to do whatever we want to do, and I am allowed to own unique, independent personal thoughts and ideas on everything, which were not very encouraged when I was in Chinese middle school five years ago. Different from teachers in middle school and primary school, professors and instructors in college leave more free space and time for me to explore new knowledge by myself.</p> 

		<p class="p4">I’m still on my way of exploration, and fortunately, the unknown future is still attractive to me. </p>

			<div class="text">The inspirations of this pattern design work was The Palace Museum. I was totally obsessed by the museum after I visited there twice. I was always wondering why and how could our ancestors create such delicate art pieces when I looked at them. Xingyuan commented me as a fangirl of Palace Museum. I admitted. There are too much I can learn from the collections and architectures in the museum. </div>

			<div class="text2">Embroidery was an experience full of both my passions and worries. I spent at least two weekends for this piece of work. Needles and threads can do everything, but they work too slow! This embroidery piece was created as a bag strap. The topic or the inspiration was a traditional Chinese mythology called “Nezha Conquers the Dragon King”. The story talked about how a boy called Nezha and owned super power defeated the evil Dragon King and saved the village. I don’t think Nezha is a hero, he was just a naughty boy.</div>
