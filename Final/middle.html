I usually began drawing on table when I felt the class was boring, and the table functioned as draft pad when I took math exams. Everyone should ever write something on the tables in the middle schools’ classrooms.</div>

Then she invited me to join her and draw this comic notebook together. All the stories included in the comic were inspired by the daily conversations among our classmates.</div>

The large blackboard in our classroom was an old style blackboard which was black instead of the new style which is dark green. The surface of the blackboard was rough, and chalks didn’t work that well on it. The board was so large that it usually took me one week or more to finish the writing and drawing.</div>

		<div class="text5">I We took studio class in middle school. The teacher was an old man who was good at hand making furniture using wood. We were too young to cut woods, so he taught us how to play with wires. He drew the patterns for us, and we used pliers to make the wires match the patterns he drew. He actually taught us more than using pliers. He also taught us what was “craftsman spirit”, which is a prevalent topic people are discussing recent years in China. We heard that his class was canceled by school since the school thought students should use the time for study.</div>
