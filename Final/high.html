		<p class="p1">I took high school in my hometown: Nanjing, China. It’s one of the best high schools in the city. I was in the international department which was especially for students who were going to study aboard for college.</p>

		<p class="p2">From the first day step into the high school classroom, I began the preparations for applying college. Papers after papers, exams after exams, and endless vocabulary and grammar to recite. These papers, exams and vocabulary recitation occupied 80% of my high school life. The three years in high school was so busy and full of good and bad memories that I can absolutely write a long novel based on them.</p> 

		<p class="p3">I have a lot to say about my high school years. I want to say nothing about my high school years.</p>

			Alexa owned her own studio two years ago, in 2015. The first public workshop the studio held was an accessory making workshop. Alexa invited me to join the workshop and it became my first experience of trying to design and make accessories. I made two earrings and a ring, although they can’t really be worn.</div>

				Farming Trip was one of the most important field trip in my high school. All the 10th grade students should go to the countryside to learn how to farm. We stay there for a whole week. It was one of my happiest week during high school. We got up 8:30 every morning, then go to the farmland and learn how to grow grains. We also went fishing and catching lobsters. Everything we did during that week was the activities that we would never have the opportunity to experience in the city. Other than farming and fishing, I was responsible for the daily poster of my class.

				The Student Senate held an online channel called “ZMB Talk”. Every month, ZMB Talk would invite a teacher to discuss a topic with students. I painted the poster for the third episode. My high school used iPads in daily teaching and learning, and many students developed the skill of painting and drawing in the note taking app. This poster was painted using the note taking app on my iPad.

				This was a board collage on running race. Almost every middle school and high school in Nanjing holds running race at the end of the year. My high school held the race in Xuanwu Lake Park, which is really large and contains a lake inside. Students ran around the lake for the race. In my thought, running race equals to new year.

				There are tooooooo many stories behind this cover for Yearbook, but I really don’t know where to start. I really enjoyed the process of designing this cover with help from Emma who is both my teacher and my good friend. I was not good at using Ps and Ai when the department principle asked me to design the cover for our yearbook. I asked Emma for help since she was graduated from design school in Paris. Emma was busy with her work, but she was very willing to help me. Thank you, Emma! 
				Unfortunately, the final outcome of the yearbook was not my design. This was another story full of sadness and betrayal.
