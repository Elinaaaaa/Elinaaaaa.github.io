I began learning how to create a schedule for my life and study by myself. I lived at school, so I had to learn to do everything by myself. I couldn’t rely on parents and adults.</p>

My whole class were transfer students; thus our first parents’ day was on 3rd grade. My mom came to see me and she joined our art class. Every time my mom came to school, she always brought me strawberries.</div>
