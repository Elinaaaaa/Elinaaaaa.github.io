<p class="main"><span id="change1">When we had got ready to set out hither,</span>the Moon met us <span id="change2">, and commanded us first to greet the Athenians and their allies;</span>and <span id="change3">then</span>  declared <span id="change4">that she was angry, for that she had suffered dreadful things, though she benefits you all, not in words, but openly. In the first place, not less than a drachma every month for torches; se that also all, when they went out of an evening, were wont to say, “Boy, don’t buy a torch, for </span>the moonlight is beautiful<span id="change5">. And she says she confers other benefits on you, but that you do not observe the days at all correctly, but confuse them up and down; so that she says the gods are constantly threatening her, when they are defrauded of their dinner, and depart home, not having met with the regular feast according to the number of the days. And then, when </span>you ought to<span id="change6"> be sacrificing, you are inflicting tortures and litigating. And often, while we gods are observing a fast, when we mourn for Memnon or Sarpedon, </span>you are<span id="change7"> pouring libations and laughing. For which reason Hyperbolus, having obtained the lot this year to be Hieromnemon, was afterward </span>deprived<span id="change8"> by us gods of his crown; for thus he will know better that he ought to </span>spend<span id="change9"> the days of </span>his life according to the Moon.
